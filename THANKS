7-Zip-JBinding THANKS file

7-Zip-JBinding has originally been written by Boris Brodski.
Many people have further contributed to it by reporting problems, 
suggesting various improvements, or submitting actual code. Here is
a list of these people. Help me keep it complete and exempt of errors.


Special thanks to

- Masoud (for pointing me to the most wired error in the C++ <-> Java exception handling)

- Victor Martinez (for getting 7-Zip-JBinding to work with JNLP)
