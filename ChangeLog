7-Zip-JBinding ChangeLog
========================

Release - 9.13-2.00alpha (Release candidate, cross-platform, based on zip/p7zip 9.13 beta)

	* Bind 7-Zip 9.13 beta
	* Archive creation
		- Creating archives: 7z, BZip2, Tar, Zip


Release - 4.65-1.03rc-extr-only (Release candidate, extraction only, cross-platform, based on zip/p7zip 4.65)
	* Binary version for MacOS 64 bit (java 6)
	
	* Support for multi-platform jars:
	  - Multiplatform releases:
	  	- AllWindows:

	  	- AllMac
	  	- AllPlatforms

	  - Initialization reworked (net.sf.sevenzipjbinding.SevenZip)
	    - SevenZip.initLibraryFromFile() removed. Please use 'System.load()' or 'System.loadLibrary()' to
	      load native libraries into JVM and then call SevenZip.initLoadedLibraries() to call 7-Zip-JBinding
	      initialization routine.
	    - Detailed JavaDoc

	* Integration test for all platforms for single and multiple platform distributions
	
	* Improve ISevenZipInArchive.extract()
		- Check for wrong indices avoiding VM crash
		- Sort indices, if not already sorted
		- Minor performance improvements
	
	* Code snippets for opening multi-part 7z and RAR archives (See web page, Code snippets)  
	
	* DEB format support + tests
	
	* RPM format support + tests

	* UDF format support + tests

	* Source code repository: moved from svn to git (http://git-scm.com/)
	  - Repository on sourceforge: git://sevenzipjbind.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/sevenzipjbind/sevenzipjbind
	  - Repository on github: git://github.com/borisbrodski/sevenzipjbinding.git
	

Release - 4.65-1.02rc-extr-only (Release candidate, extraction only, cross-platform, based on zip/p7zip 4.65)

	* Binary version for Windows 64 XP and above.

	* NSIS format support + tests

	* New method ISevenZipInArchive.getArchiveFormat() returns format of the opened archive, 
	  even if archive format auto-detection was used.
	
	* Better performance for archive format auto-detection


Release - 4.65-1.01rc-extr-only (Release candidate, extraction only, cross-platform, based on zip/p7zip 4.65)

	* API change was necessary to fix a bug:
		- net.sf.sevenzipjbinding.IArchiveExtractCallback.prepareOperation(ExtractAskMode) is void now.
		
		- net.sf.sevenzipjbinding.IArchiveExtractCallback.getStream(int, ExtractAskMode) accepts null return values now.
		  null return values can be used to skip on the fly extraction/testing of archive items. 

	* net.sf.sevenzipjbinding.ISevenZipInArchive.extract(int[], boolean, IArchiveExtractCallback):
		- the first parameter "int[]" is optional now. If null value passed all archive items will be extracted.
		  It if possible to exclude particular items later on using IArchiveExtractCallback call back. Returning null
		  out of net.sf.sevenzipjbinding.IArchiveExtractCallback.getStream method will skip extraction/testing. 

	* CAB format support + tests

	* LZH format support + tests

	* CHM format support + tests

	* Dashboard project added: http://my.cdash.org/index.php?project=7-Zip-JBinding

	* Bugfix: crash, if access archive object out of a call back method

	* Support for volumed 7z and rar archives

	* Over 3000 JUnit tests extraction of archive formats: 7z, Arj, BZip2, Cpio, GZip, ISO, Lzma, Rar, Tar, Z, Zip 

	* Use CMake to build, test and package on different operating systems

	* 7-Zip-JBinding requires Java 1.5 or higher

	* Complete rework of entire code
	
	* Compression method auto detection
	
	* Base java package changed from "net.sf.sevenzip" to "net.sf.sevenzipjbinding"
	
	* Helper class to open volumed 7z archives (assemble multiple InStreams into single InStream)
