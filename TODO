Other TODOs:
- Prevent JVM from crash in OutOfMemory cases (see JavaStaticInfo.cpp)

- Post a issue for p7zip: core dump if referencing not existing archive item (index out of range).
  For example: GetProperty(10000000, 3). Extract function is also affected.

- Post a issue for 7zip/p7zip: extracting empty files from LZH archive (method 6, 7)

- Test extracting encrypted archive where different password for different files are used.

- Offer a source package without tests

- Repack XAR (bz2) tests with new version of xar

- Find optimal gcc optimization parameters (See CPP/7zip/CMAKE/*) (Consider using -D_7ZIP_LARGE_PAGES on 64bit systems), -pipe

- Bind SetProperty("CRC", ...) for extraction of 7z archives and compression of XZ-archives

- Test: creation of password protected archives (7z, zip, ??)
- Test: create archives with unicode symbols in PATH 

- Write tests to check, that all enumerations are mapped correctly
  - NCoderID
  - ExtractAskMode
  - ExtractOperationResult

- Add to integration tests
  - Test, that the release and not the debug compilation of the binary was used to build each platform jar

- In callbacks: Delete all local refs (jniEnvInstance->DeleteLocalRef(...)) in error cases (return S_FALSE)
- In callbacks: Delete all local refs returned by jni.

Minor TODOs:
- OutItem: Check, that "(flag & DIRECTORY) <=> (isDir = true)" + test
- CallbackTester: Test more callbacks (extraction(todo) + compression(done))
- Write more tests, for example, extracting archive with two files encrypted with different password.
- Write test to use OutArchive more then ones before closing it. Verify, that all feature settings remains unchanged.
- Test some untested archive formats (NFS, ...)
- Redesign Web site
- Fix ZIP compression test modification time check ("TODO This breaks for unknown reason in multithreaded ZIP-test.")
- Add file extension field to the ArchiveFormat enum (+JavaDoc)
- Web: create favicon.ico

Major TODOs:
- Support more archive formats
- Support 7-zip volumes (see INTERFACE_IArchiveUpdateCallback2)
- Support ICompressProgressInfo
- Add Xz compression/decompression
- Test .ar, .a, .lib extension (DEB already tested) (from ArHandler.cpp)

Checklists
 - Bind new version of 7-zip
   * Copy from p7zip and verify PlatformMinGW/* content
