4. Version number guide lines
-----------------------------

The scheme for the 7-Zip-JBinding version numbers is :

	<7-Zip/p7zip version> - <7-Zip-JBinding major version>.<7-Zip-JBinding minor version><release stage><impl. stage>

7-Zip/p7zip version - version of the underlying 7-Zip and p7zip libraries.

7-Zip-JBinding major version - major version of 7-Zip-JBinding base on the specified 7-Zip/p7zip version, beginning from 1 
7-Zip-JBinding minor version - major version of 7-Zip-JBinding base on the specified 7-Zip/p7zip version, beginning from 0

release stage:
	- 'alpha' - alpha release: substantion part of the functionality included, not stable. For testing purposes only.
	- 'rc' - release candidate: all functionality included, not stable. For testing purposes only.
	- '' - release considered stable. For generally use.
	
impl stage: (implementation stage)
	Optional. Information about implemented and not implemented features.
	- '-extr-only' - compression features are not included. 

Examples:
	 4.65-1.0alpha - Alpha release of 7-Zip-JBinding version 1.0 based on 7-Zip/p7zip version 4.65
	 4.66-1.01rc - Release candidate of 7-Zip-JBinding version 1.1 based on 7-Zip/p7zip version 4.66
	 4.66-2.3-extr-only - Stable release of 7-Zip-JBinding version 2.3 based on 7-Zip/p7zip version 4.66
	 				      without compression features.
	 4.66-2.3 - Stable release of 7-Zip-JBinding version 2.3 based on 7-Zip/p7zip version 4.66


5. Compile
----------

Please note, you will need a source code distribution to compile 7-Zip-JBinding.


5.1 Compile on Linux

a) Download source package from http://sourceforge.net/projects/sevenzipjbind/files/
   and extract it into some <srcdir> directory. Try to avoid directory names with spaces in your path.

   Optionally you can checkout a trunk (current development version) from GIT repository 
	$ git clone git://sevenzipjbind.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/sevenzipjbind/sevenzipjbind SevenZipJBinding
	$ cd SevenZipJBinding
	$ git checkout Release-4.65-1.02rc-extr-only

b) You will need the CMake (2.6 or higher) to configure 7-Zip-JBinding for your system.
   You can check the version of your CMake by typing:
	$ cmake --version

   If you don't have cmake installed or cmake version isn't sufficient you can download and install CMake from official
   web site: http://www.cmake.org/
 
   On Debian or Ubuntu Linux you can install cmake by typing
    $ sudo apt-get install cmake

c) The next step is to run CMake. Both in-source and out-of-source methods are supported. Here is example of in-source build:
	$ cmake .

   Where <srcdir> is a directory, where you extracted or checked out the source code.	
   On some Linux distributions you will need to set JAVA_JDK cmake option to your Java JDK 1.5 or higher. You can use a GUI CMake
   tool 'cmake-gui', edit 'CMakeCache.txt' file with your favorite text editor or just delete 'CMakeCache.txt' file
   and restart CMake with a -DJAVA_JDK parameter:
	$ cmake . -DJAVA_JDK=<path-to-jdk>
   
   If everything goes right, you will get an overview of chosen tools and build options.

d) Now type to compile 7-Zip-JBinding
	$ make
	
e) After make succeeds you can either run tests by typing
	$ ctest
	or
	$ ctest -D Experimental
	to submit test results to the dashboard (http://my.cdash.org/index.php?project=7-Zip-JBinding)
   
f) You can build a binary package by typing
    $ make package
    

5.2 Compile on Windows
    Both MinGW and Cygwin environments can be used to compile 7-Zip-JBinding. Using MinGW to compile 7-Zip-JBinding 
    is recommended and is much easier. The steps are:

a) Download and install MinGW from the official web site: http://www.mingw.org/
b) Download and install CMake from the official web site: http://www.cmake.org/
c) Download and extract 7-Zip-Binding source package from http://sourceforge.net/projects/sevenzipjbind/files/
d) Open cmd console, go into the directory with extracted 7-Zip-Binding source and type  
	D:\...> cmake -G"MinGW Makefiles" .
e) Type
	D:\...> mingw32-make.exe
f) Type 'ctest' to run tests or 'mingw32-make.exe package' to build a binary package


If you have any troubles with 7-Zip-JBinding please, ask for help. Use forum or issue tracker on sourceforge:

6 Developer notes

6.1 Binding new 7-Zip release

TODO describe this

- In StringConvert.cpp
  - Remove SystemStringToOemString() method
- In StringConvert.h 
  - Remove SystemStringToOemString() method definition
- Verify, that the implementations in
  - PlatformMinGW/MyWindows.cpp
  - PlatformMinGW/MyUser32.cpp
  still match corresponding implementation in the p7zip



Have fun!
